Exercise One: Solving Day-to-Day problems
Apply the problem-solving steps to the following situations:

Find the most convenient path from Silo Park to Business School.
Organise a group meeting to discuss project ideas for INFOSYS 221.

Silo Park Problem: Use maps to find the best solution for elimination, visualising different branches/options

1. Use maps to find the best solution for elimination, visualising different branches/options
2. We can use the following algorithm: - Branch and Bound In order to go from Silo Park to the UoA Business School.




Exercise Three: Fibonacci Sequence
Apply the problem-solving steps to the following:

Find the value at the nth position in the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, where the next number is the sum of the previous numbers. For example, if n is 6, then the value is 8 (the Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2,3, 5, 8).


1. Get the first two fibonacci parameters 1 & 2. 
2. Calculate the third by doing last value = last value[-1] + last value[-2]
3. Repeat step 2 n - 3 times.
4. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
